# 🎵 Melodify — Music Streaming Website

A full-featured music streaming web application with user authentication, a song library with a YouTube-powered player, playlist support, an admin panel, and a real-time karaoke recorder. Built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) — migrated from the original PHP + MySQL version (archived in `legacy/`).

## ✨ Features

### User Side
- **Multi-step sign-up flow** — email → password → profile details (name, DOB, gender, country)
- **Login / Logout** with JWT authentication and bcrypt password hashing
- **Song library** — search by song title or artist, browse a poster grid
- **Recently Played** — horizontal slider of your latest 20 played songs (per-user history)
- **Full audio player** — play/pause, next/previous, shuffle, repeat, volume control, mute, seekable progress bar with time labels; streams every song via the **YouTube IFrame API** (no local MP3 storage), with an `<audio>` fallback for user-uploaded songs
- **Official posters** — every song's poster comes from its official **YouTube thumbnail** (`img.youtube.com`); local uploads keep their uploaded poster
- **Now Playing panel** — song title, artist, genre, duration, release date
- **Upload songs** — any user can add songs with MP3/WAV audio + JPG/PNG poster via a modal form
- **Profile page** — view/edit personal info, change password
- **Dynamic Playlist page** (`/playlist/:id`) — per-user playlists with real songs, add/remove/rename/delete, search the library to add songs, built-in floating player (YouTube streaming)
- **Dynamic Song Details page** (`/song/:id`) — real song metadata + related tracks (same artist/genre), full footer player with shuffle/repeat/seek/volume
- **Dynamic Premium page** (`/premium`) — live subscription status, subscribe/cancel plans (Individual/Student/Duo) via `/api/subscriptions`

## 🚀 Getting Started

> **Need full step-by-step instructions (including the Admin Panel guide)?** See **[`RUNNING_AND_ADMIN_GUIDE.md`](./RUNNING_AND_ADMIN_GUIDE.md)**.
> **Database setup & MongoDB Compass connection?** See **[`MONGODB_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md`](./MONGODB_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md)**.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (installed on `G:\NodeJS` on this machine)
- [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (installed on `G:\MongoDB` on this machine)

### 1. Start MongoDB
```bash
mongod --dbpath G:\MongoDB\data
```

### 2. Seed the database
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run seed
```

### 3. Run the API server
```bash
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5000
```

### 4. Run the React frontend
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

### 5. Run the karaoke app (optional)
```bash
cd karaoke-app/server
npm install
npm start          # http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔑 Admin Credentials

The admin password is **never hardcoded** in the codebase. Set it in `server/.env` (gitignored):

```env
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@melodify.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-strong-password
```

- If `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is missing when seeding, a random password is generated and printed to the console once.
- Then run `npm run seed` in `server/` to create the admin user, and access the panel at `/admin`.
- See [`RUNNING_AND_ADMIN_GUIDE.md`](./RUNNING_AND_ADMIN_GUIDE.md) for the full admin guide.

## 🎨 Design

- Homepage layout uses a shared 1170px desktop content width with fluid 24px gutters.
- The homepage navigation is a 60px fixed glass header with a fine blue separator.
- Home/Premium/Studio/Feed links use compact bright labels; Home has an accessible current-page state and violet/blue underline.
- The search field uses a compact 223 × 33px navy pill with an accessible label and readable placeholder.
- Header actions use an outline bell and a 32px purple profile circle linking to profile or sign-in according to authentication.
- The desktop hero is a compact 390px composition aligned to the shared content container.
- Hero art is cropped into the right half, mirrored toward the text, with masked edges rather than a rectangular photo panel.
- Blue/violet color lighting and dark tonal grading unify the listener portrait with the hero atmosphere.
- Hero eyebrow copy uses compact 13px white lettering with restrained tracking above the headline.
- The desktop headline is 48px and preserves exactly two lines: “Every Sound.” / “One Universe.”
- “Sound.” uses violet emphasis and “Universe.” transitions into blue; solid-color and forced-color fallbacks keep both words readable.
- Hero supporting copy is constrained to 380px with pale-blue 15px text and compact three-line desktop wrapping.
- Hero actions are 44px pills with a 16px gap: a white-on-gradient primary and a navy outlined secondary.
- A short dark hero fade flows into Trending with a 22px section inset instead of large stacked vertical padding.
- Trending has an 18px heading, short violet/blue accent, compact subtitle, and vertically centered View All action.
- Trending keeps six equal desktop cards and reserves a compact loading grid while `/api/songs?limit=6` resolves.
- Trending cards have dark navy surfaces, subtle borders, 10px corners, and stationary hover/focus feedback. The grid uses six columns above 1024px, four on small tablets, three at 768px and below, and two at 480px and below, with compact 14–10px gaps and shared container gutters.
- Studio and Premium promotions share the Trending container, a 36px section inset, and equal-width, equal-height desktop cards separated by 16px. Compact content determines card height above a 154px minimum; cards stack below 769px without fixed-height clipping.
- The Studio promotion is a labeled article with a narrow, decorative equipment strip beside its copy, pale-blue supporting text, and a violet-outlined pill linking to Studio or sign-up according to authentication. Its two-column composition adapts without overlaying the text on photography.
- Each card uses 66px inset artwork. `client/public/home/poster-fallback.svg` is a local fallback with a one-shot error guard.
- Song metadata uses compact title/artist/duration rows; long names truncate visually while retaining their full tooltip text.
- Persistent 29px outlined play affordances sit at each card’s bottom-right; the whole card preserves existing song/sign-up navigation.
- Durations accept API clock strings, numeric seconds, and explicitly marked milliseconds (`duration_ms` or `ms` suffix); unavailable/invalid values display an em dash. Run `node --test src/components/home/formatDuration.test.js` from `client/` for the regression checks.
- Hero photography: [Andrea Piacquadio / Pexels, photo 3771823](https://www.pexels.com/photo/3771823/), a headphone listener. The previously supplied Unsplash URL resolves to a microphone and is intentionally replaced. The reference screenshot remains local-only.
- `components/home/Waveform.jsx` supplies a reusable blue/violet SVG brand mark with collision-free gradient IDs.
- **Homepage** — reference-led redesign with page-scoped CSS injected on mount. The injection strips a leading U+FEFF defensively so the root selector, dark color scheme, and theme variables resolve even with BOM-emitting editors.
- Homepage implementation checkpoints are numbered `01/50`–`50/50` on `ehsanul`, after baseline `6a16a8e97e72a52cf563efe32d49c0646238bdb1`. Resume from the latest numbered commit and preserve any uncommitted work.
- **Homepage palette** — near-black/navy surfaces, pale-blue secondary text, and blue/violet accents. Typography and color scope remain local to the homepage.
- Responsive 3-column layout (Library | Songs | Now Playing)
- Hover animations, smooth transitions, custom scrollbars
- Other pages retain their independent page styles.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Songs stream from YouTube** — the 14 seeded songs play through the YouTube IFrame API (each has a `youtube_id` + official YouTube thumbnail poster), so no local MP3 files are needed for them. Local files are only used for songs uploaded by users (`assets/songs/uploads/`, not tracked in git).
- **YouTube thumbnails** are fetched from `https://img.youtube.com/vi/<youtube_id>/hqdefault.jpg` at seed time and stored as `poster_url`; the UI falls back to a placeholder if a thumbnail ever fails to load.
- The old PHP + MySQL implementation (including `all_data.sql`) and the former static pages (`playlist/`, `song-details/`, `premium/`) are archived in `legacy/` for reference.
- **All pages are now dynamic React pages** — no dummy/static content remains in the app; Playlist, Song Details, and Premium are fully backed by the API.
- This is a university/project build; some admin actions (ban, edit, delete) are demo stubs.
